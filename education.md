What policies should we propose to give our children a good education?

## Higher education

All higher education will be free at the point of use, funded by a graduate tax of 0.3% for lower earners, rising to a maximum of 2.5% for top earners. This will be payable for 20 years after the student has graduated.

This would encourage students to take up places at university by removing the stigma of debt, and would ensure that those who have benefitted more from their education financially would pick up more of the bill.
