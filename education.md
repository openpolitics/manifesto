What policies should we propose to give our children a good education?

## Secular Schools

50% of the British public identify as having no religion, and this number is growing[1] but over half of all state funded schools have a religious character[2], including over 4,500 Church of England schools. It has been demonstrated that faith schools are religiously selective, excluding those of other or no faith[3].

Therefore, we will mandate that all state-funded schools be secular in nature.

No state funded school will be permitted to admit students based on religiosity.

We will end compulsory worship in schools.

State-funded faith schools will also lose their exemption to equalities legislation, preventing them from practising religious discrimination in their employment policies.

Religious education (R.E.) will also be reviewed, starting with research on the current state of R.E. and followed by a consultation to include all interested parties on whether to keep R.E., reform it, or replace it.

Scottish authorities will no longer be legally obligated to appoint unelected religious representatives to school boards. Instead, elected councillors will be appointed by a vote of the full council.
