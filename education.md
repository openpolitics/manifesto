## Principles of Education

We believe that education is the keystone that makes all other longer-term strategic policies possible: improving industry and employment; the arts; scientific discovery and research; improving the overall health and well-being of society; and reducing crime. It is the policy area that can justify significant investment in recognition of the dividend that all other areas of public spending will receive 10-15 years hence.

Subsequently we recognise that education is about more than simply equipping the future workforce with relevant vocational and professional skills, but about creating a future society that is healthy, wise, and wealthy in all respects.

We believe that learning is life long and should be encouraged in all elements of life, personal and professional.

## Funding

Education should be freely available to all to first degree level or equivalent. Tuition fees for university students should be abolished, as university education is of general benefit to society, and should be covered by general taxation.

## Secular Schools

50% of the British public identify as having no religion, and this number is growing[^1] but over half of all state funded schools have a religious character[^2], including over 4,500 Church of England schools. It has been demonstrated that faith schools are religiously selective, excluding those of other or no faith[^3].

Therefore, we will mandate that all state-funded schools be secular in nature.

No state funded school will be permitted to admit students based on religiosity.

We will end compulsory worship in schools.

State-funded faith schools will also lose their exemption to equalities legislation, preventing them from practising religious discrimination in their employment policies.

Religious education (R.E.) will be replaced by Philosophy and Comparative Religion, and content in other subjects that is based on religious beliefs which are divisive (such as homosexuality) or not scientifically valid (such as creationism) will not be allowed.

Scottish authorities will no longer be legally obligated to appoint unelected religious representatives to school boards. Instead, elected councillors will be appointed by a vote of the full council.

## School Governance

All state secondary schools will have an elected students council, and student president. The student president, who will need to be at key stage 4, will represent students on the board of governors.

## Focus on Education

We will remove the guidelines[^4] that force teachers to act as counter-terrorism officers and that stifle free speech within the learning environment. 

## Evidence based Learning

We recognise the tension between the coercion inherent in 'being taught' to follow a curriculum and testing regime, and the innate drive of self motivated learning, which is a biological mandate, where the student requests specific help to explore a given subject area, based on their interest and resources. [^5]

We therefore suggest that all teaching staff, support staff in Education be trained in the ethics of Education without compulsion, and furthermore, that all teaching staff undergo training in empathy, conflict resolution, open democracy, child development and other areas aligned to the welfare and healthy development  of our children as people, as the future adults of this Society. How we treat the child determines the emerging psychology of the future.

We recognise a wide variety of psychologies and perspectives amongst our children, and suggest that these be understood and worked with, rather than policed, controlled or medicated as class room management strategies. The Natural Child, the child that learns by exploration, observation, experimentation, critical analysis is a biological mandate, and it represents the greatest variety of ways of being available to any given community, and it should be at the very centre of our Education system. 

## Separation from Militarisation.

We suggest that the Military Cadet system be removed from all schools, and be replace with something that provides the opportunity to learn and explore the same skills divorced from Militarisation. Military activity is about killing, and has no place in a rational, humane environment. Enlistment in the armed forces ought to be something chosen by adults who are well informed, mature and resilient, rather than children or teenagers who can have only a fantasy perception of the realities of military action.

As part of that we also suggest that History be an exploration, rather than rote learning of 'approved' texts. Children ought to be allowed to explore all available materials as individuals, then encouraged to bring what they have found back to share with their fellow students, and to discuss what they have found, in order to arrive at a more nuanced understanding and to help the children to develope their innate critical thinking skills in a group setting. Varied perspectives can then be integrated. We would look to the quality of their logic and research, their ability to define, integrate and refine, in written and spoken word, as the measure of their progress.
