What policies should we propose to improve the fabric of society?

Decline of the High Street

The local high street is in slow decline (or not so slow in some areas) whereas out of town shopping centres enjoy many unfair benefits. It is therefore proposed that all out of town shopping centres and town centre supermarkets are required to charge for their parking, with the fees generated being distributed between local authorities in the surrounding areas. Local authorities should then be encouraged to reduce the prices charged in their town centre car parks to nominal sums. This should hopefully reduce overall emissions as residents journey the much shorter distance into town, rather than to their regional shopping centre.

Local Authorities should also be encouraged to reimburse residents for any bus return ticket to the town centre. Local shops would reimburse shoppers on presentation of a return ticket when they spend Â£20 or more in any given shop. Each shop should claim back that sum from the local authority.
