What policies should we propose to improve the fabric of society?

Volunteering for children (currently called National Citizen Service for 16 and 17 year olds) should be widened to ensure all children are involved as soon as they commence secondary education.

To encourage volunteering in adulthood, there should be tax-breaks which equate to the number of hours volunteered each year.

The state should be able to honour deceased individuals in ways that the current Honours System does not allow (eg remove the specific number of places within the Order of the Bath which prevents the ability to grant knighthoods to the deceased). The award of State Honours should be decided by Committee appointed from within an elected Upper Chamber of Parliament.
