What policies should we propose to improve the fabric of society?

## Secularism

With 50% of the British public having no religion, including 64% of 18-24 year olds[1], Britain is no longer a Christian country and so its official status as such will be removed. Britain will become a secular nation under a Secularism Act.

Human rights are paramount, because we are all human but not all religious. No-one should be restricted from practising their religious beliefs unless those beliefs infringe on the human rights of others. Equally, the non-religious or those of other religions, should be free of interference from religions. So we will enshrine in law two principles;
* Freedom from religion and
* Freedom of religion

Disestablishment of the Church of England.

Ending prayers in Parliament and local government.

When Government seeks advice from religious groups they will also be required to consult groups representing of non-theists.

All human rights exemptions for religious organisations, such as discrimination in recruitment, will be revoked.

Religious organisations operating public services will be explicitly banned from promoting their religion in the process in order to protect vulnerable members of society.

Religious individuals delivering public services wishing to conscientiously object will be limited from doing so in all but the most extreme cases (e.g. doctors and abortion).
