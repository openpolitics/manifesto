# Code of Conduct

## Brief
This code of conduct aims to detail the nature of improper conduct and explain how the complaints process works.

## Who can file a complaint?
All have the right to file a complaint regardless of position or status.

## Who handles the complaint?
You will be asked upon the submission of a complaint who you wish to address it to. If a dispute cannot be settled between the relevant parties, then you must address a complaint to the complaints bureau. A complaints jury will determine whether or not your submitted complaint is valid and actionable. Complaints addressed to party leadership regarding other members will be automatically forwarded to the complaints bureau.

## What are the rules for the jury?
Examples of non-protected speech include:
Credible threats of physical harm
Words or imagery that are demonstrable of actual malice
Publishing others' private information such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission

## What is the burden of proof required?
In order to meet the standard and prove something by clear and convincing evidence, a party must prove that it is substantially more likely than not that it is true.

## Who determines the process?
The rules of conduct and discourse shall be determined by party members themselves. The responsibility of party leadership begins and ends at authorising the use of such outcomes based on the verdict arrived at by the jury. It must never be the responsibility of party leadership to determine whether conduct is acceptable or not within the public realm, or in any other place.

## What rights do you posess?
You have the right to a representative. Representatives will be called upon to volunteer to represent your case. Should no one volunteer to represent you a representative will be called upon based on current availability and random ballot. You may choose to represent yourself, or may choose no representation at all.
