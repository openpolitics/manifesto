The current political parties in the UK are not serving the public interest. There is not enough choice, little informed debate, and no challenge to the prevailing narrative. Those of us who believe in, and are working towards, a better future have nobody to represent us.

We believe that a better kind of government is possible; one based on openness, transparency, evidence, and citizen engagement. We believe that it is time for those of us who have a stake in the future to stand up, and change the system from the inside.

The next UK general election is in 2015. We aim to field candidates in that election, and to have a platform for them to stand on.

## Principles

We believe that government should serve the people, and that 'the state', so often derided, is simply the way that citizens work together to enhance the public good.

We believe that government should be:

* Open, transparent and accountable, with no hiding place for backroom influence
* Rational, with decisions and policy based on sound evidence, not media pressure
* Courageous, able to make difficult decisions without pandering to short-termism

We believe that individuals should be:

* Free to act in any manner that does not harm another individual, and does not infringe upon the rights of other individuals.
* Enjoy a fundamental right to privacy from the state or their agents. 

In short, we wish to ensure government remains open and transparent, whilst individuals retain liberty and privacy.

We believe that we are heading towards a better future, and that government has an essential role in taking us there. We also believe that as a country, we can self-govern *better* in the future, and will create policy that hopes to re-engage citizens in our democratic process.

## The Manifesto

We are writing a manifesto, but we need to build it together. [It's easy to contribute](contributing.html). Do you feel strongly about some area of government policy? Why not add your ideas? We need policy across all areas of the public sphere:

<ul>
  {% for page in site.pages %}
    {% if page.layout == "policy" %}
      <li> <a href='{{site.baseurl}}{{page.url}}'>{{ page.title }}</a></li>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

Your contribution doesn't have to be huge; we need starting points before we get into all the detail.
