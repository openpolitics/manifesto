This is a project to create a new kind of politics. We're starting by writing a manifesto, but we want everyone to build it *together*. Click the button above to start reading, and click "Edit" at the top right to add your own ideas.

Everyone has ideas about the future - why not add yours? Perhaps you can see something on here you disagree with? Nothing on this site is set in stone - everything and anything is up for discussion, amending, or changing entirely. Your contribution doesn't have to be huge - everything helps!

This is a non-partisan project, and we invite all political parties and candidates to adopt this Manifesto of policy ideas. We're really pleased that [Something New](http://www.somethingnew.org.uk) are the first political party to do so, and we hope others will soon follow. The list of candidates standing for election who have openly pledged to adopt the Open Politics Manifesto can be found [here](/candidates.html).

## Why?

The current political landscape in the UK is not serving the public interest. There is not enough choice, little informed debate, and no challenge to the prevailing narrative. Those of us who believe in, and are working towards, a better future have nobody to represent us.

We believe that a better kind of government is possible; one based on openness, transparency, evidence, and citizen engagement. We believe that it is time for those of us who have a stake in the future to stand up, and change the system from the inside.

There are many people thinking about the new opportunities that the Internet brings to government; we aim to put some of those ideas into practice, and give people something to vote for, starting here.
