I fully support the views of OpenPolitics manifesto. I have recently resigned from the Liberal Democrat party because although I subscribe to their constitution that "no-one should be enslaved by poverty or ignorance", the party, as part of the political establishment is "enslaved by ignorance". That there is "no alternative" to the existing economic operating system. However, there is; I have published a POD and e-book that outlines the an economic operating system based on the science of cybernetics and systems thinking that would reduce inequality, make poverty history and reduce mental health problems induced by the stresses of government regulation on the self employed and benefit claimants alike.

I resigned from Liberal Democrat party with a view to forming my own political party, "the Millennium Party". However, I have been advised by Javier Livas in an e-mail that in order to change people's perceptions or paradigm it would better to name it something like a Global Network, not as a party at all because that would keep people in their existing mindset. Another organisation, ICUK, the Independent Constitutionalists of the UK has recently been  set up the party may find of interest; their website is ICUK.life
title: The OpenPolitics Manifesto
---

We believe that government should serve the people, and that "the state", so often derided, is simply the way that citizens work together to enhance the public good.

We believe that government should be:

* Open, transparent and accountable, with no hiding place for backroom influence.
* Rational, with decisions and policy based on sound evidence, not media pressure.
* Courageous, able to make difficult decisions without pandering to short-termism.
* Ethical: dedicated to creating a sustainable society and economy with progressive moral values.
* Bottom-up: People should be telling the government what they want from a local level, rather than being told from the top. 

We believe that individuals should:

* Be treated equally by the law, without discrimination[^discrimination], and be entitled to equal protection of the law.
* Be free to act in any manner that does not harm another individual without their consent, and does not infringe upon the rights of other individuals.
* Enjoy a fundamental right to privacy from the state or their agents.

[^discrimination]: On the basis of gender identity, disability, sex, romantic orientation, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, perceived ethnicity and/or race, age, religious and/or spiritual belief, occupation, union membership, marital status, or any other status based on the group, class, or category to which a person is perceived to belong.

In short, we wish to ensure government remains open and transparent, whilst individuals retain liberty and privacy.

We believe that we are heading towards a better future, and that government has an essential role in taking us there. We also believe that as a country, we can self-govern *better* in the future, and will create policy that hopes to re-engage citizens in our democratic process.

The ideas contained in this manifesto are intentionally idealistic; they show the direction we would like to see the UK head in. They are not necessarily policies that could be implemented tomorrow (although a few could be). Any attempt to implement them would certainly take a good deal of work, time, and reform, but we believe it's important to have a long-term roadmap to which to refer.
