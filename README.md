# The OpenPolitics Manifesto

This is an experiment in collaboratively creating a political movement.

You can read the manifesto by looking at the [main website](http://openpolitics.github.io/manifesto).

## How to take part

This repository stores the full text and history of the manifesto. Anyone can change or add something. See [the contributor guide](http://openpolitics.github.io/manifesto/contributing.html) for details on how to start making your own changes using prose.io and github.

You can also raise issues in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/openpolitics/manifesto/issues) for things that you think need doing.
