## Copyright Reform

Re-introduce copyright reforms that allow personal format-shifting of purchased media (for example, from CD to MP3, or for backup purposes)[^format-shifting].

[^format-shifting]: *"Copyright exemption for private use: regulations quashed"*, Barker Brettell, September 25, 2015. [https://www.barkerbrettell.co.uk/copyright-exemption-for-private-use-regulations-quashed-2/](https://www.barkerbrettell.co.uk/copyright-exemption-for-private-use-regulations-quashed-2/)

Adopt the "[Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use)" system as a replacement for "[Fair Dealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_dealing_in_United_Kingdom_law)".

Immediately reduce the term of copyright from "70 years from the end of the calendar year of the author's death" to two 40 year terms, with a renewal necessary after the first 40 years. Make the necessary preparations for a general case within the World Trade Organization's Dispute Settlement Body, regarding UK conformity with the [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Literary_and_Artistic_Works)).

Lobby for the rest of the world to adopt the same - two 40 years terms - for copyright.

## Advertising

Encourage the Advertising Standards Authority to tighten regulations around the use of pseudo-scientific language and terminology for the promotion of cosmetic, toiletry, food or other products, without sufficient evidence.

## Media Retractions

Media outlet retractions should mirror the original article. This covers font size, word count, page space and positioning within the document. If a media outlet does not follow this it will receive a fine from Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO).

## The BBFC and Media Classification

We believe that a non-governmental organisation (NGO) should never be able to assert legality of a given thing, whether that be media, furniture, or types of hat. Thus, the BBFC will be stripped of any and all powers it holds, including their ability to rate a film in such a way that it restricts who can buy it in a shop that is in no way connected to the NGO.

Whilst we believe that no non-governmental organisation should be able to assert the legality of a given thing, we do accept that media classification may be useful for consumers. Therefore, the BBFC will be open to competition against any new classification bodies.

Under new legislation, no classification body will have the ability to make purchases of the film by those under the rated age illegal, nor will shops have the right to prevent the sale of such films to said age range (as we recognise that age is not the sole determinant of maturity), with the exception of pornographic films.

All film classification entities must have ratings (that are not legally binding to the store or customer) relating to:

* the recommended age of the viewer,
* the environment under the [EMA Green Seal](http://www.green4ema.org/ema-green-seal/) system,
* female representation (a ranking that increases when a movie passes the [Bechdel test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test), the ["Mako Mori" test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test#Derived_tests), has multiple female cast members that affect the plot in a manner that does not merely advance the story for another character, and does not include the trope of the [Ms. Male Character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYqYLfm1rWA))
* male representation (a rating that judges through ranking whether: a film advances themes of [male disposability](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/wiki/resources/rbomi#wiki_section_1.3A_male_disposability), deals with any "mens issues", portrays them in a negative light (to the extent of not being violent, sexually abusive, unable to be trusted with children, 'deadbeat dads', commitment phobic or in need of 're-construction'.), has exclusively male villains, or portrays young boys in such a manner that it could be said  they are portrayed as defective girls. [^mens-issues-in-media] )
* race issues (evaluating the ethnic diversity of the cast and, to a lesser extent, the crew, whether it passes the [shukla test](http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/10/after-bechdel-test-i-propose-shukla-test-race-film): wherein two characters of non white ethnicity have a discussion without mentioning the race of the other in a film that isn't about race issues; and whether two characters, one of white ethnicity and the other of non white ethnicity, can have a discussion without mentioning the race of the other in a film that isn't about race issues)
* LGBTQIAP+ issues (analyzing whether a film passes the [Vito Russo Test](http://www.glaad.org/releases/glaad-introduces-studio-responsibility-index-report-lgbt-images-films-released-big-six))
