## Copyright Reform

Re-introduce copyright reforms that allow personal format-shifting of purchased media (for example, from CD to MP3, or for backup purposes)[^format-shifting].

[^format-shifting]: *"Copyright exemption for private use: regulations quashed"*, Barker Brettell, September 25, 2015. [https://www.barkerbrettell.co.uk/copyright-exemption-for-private-use-regulations-quashed-2/](https://www.barkerbrettell.co.uk/copyright-exemption-for-private-use-regulations-quashed-2/)

Adopt the "[Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use)" system as a replacement for "[Fair Dealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_dealing_in_United_Kingdom_law)".

Immediately reduce the term of copyright from "70 years from the end of the calendar year of the author's death" to two 40 year terms, with a renewal necessary after the first 40 years. Make the necessary preparations for a general case within the World Trade Organization's Dispute Settlement Body, regarding UK conformity with the [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Literary_and_Artistic_Works)).

Lobby for the rest of the world to adopt the same - two 40 years terms - for copyright.

## Advertising

Encourage the Advertising Standards Authority to tighten regulations around the use of pseudo-scientific language and terminology for the promotion of cosmetic, toiletry, food or other products, without sufficient evidence.

## Media Retractions

Media outlet retractions should mirror the original article. This covers font size, word count, page space and positioning within the document. If a media outlet does not follow this it will receive a fine from Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO).
