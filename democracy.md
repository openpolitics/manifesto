How can we improve the democratic process, and citizens' engagement with it?

## Elections

Allow for full and proper recall of MPs: any e-petition to recall their MP supported by 20% of all registered constituency electors should trigger a local referendum (yes/no majority vote required) as to whether to hold a fresh bi-election.

Introduce an 'None of the Above' box on all ballot papers to formally and positively register abstention.

Introduce voting by proportional representation (Single Transferable Vote) in all General and Local Elections.

Investigate feasability of electronic voting at all elections, with a view to increasing accessibility and turnout.

Investigate feasability of direct digital democracy - using online tools to gradually replace representative democracy with increased direct participation in the legislative process by all electors.

Much apathy is focused around the perceived privilege of the political class. This is reinforced by the costs of attempting to stand for election. In the digital age, where a political campaign can be waged at little to no cost, the £500 deposit required to stand for election excludes some of the most enthusiastic and contributory members of society. These are people who often spent a majority of time volunteering in their community and don't have the income to save for such a high fee. Candidacy should be open to all, regardless of financial wealth, if we are to have an open democracy, so this deposit will be removed.

To deter time wasters, the current requirement of 10 nominations from the electorate to obtain candidacy will be increased to 20.

Reduce the age of voting at General, Scottish, and European Elections (ie to legislative bodies) and all national and local referenda to those aged 16 years and above.

Reduce the age of voting at Local Elections and to the Welsh Assemby (ie to non-legislative bodies) to those aged 15 to encourage youth participation in democracy prior to enjoying full voting right at 16. 

## Party Funding

Limit all donations and loans to political parties, campaign, lobbying and interest groups to a maximum of £5,000 from individuals and groups.

## Lords Reform

Create an elected Upper House of Parliament for single 15 year terms, with the explicit purpose of revising and improving (not vetoing) legislation initiated by HM Government in the House of Commons.

Abolish automatic bishops from the House of Lords.

## Transparency

Require all MPs to publish details of any meeting with any individual or group who is not a constituent.

## Devolution

Devolve all legislative powers currently enjoyed by the Scottish Parliament to equivalent devolved Parliaments in England, Wales and (eventually) Northern Ireland. The UK Parliament to retain control over macro-economic, foreign, and defence policy. 

## MPs pay and expenses

MPs should be paid a good wage, based on the income profile of the country. It could, for instance, be set at the 75th income percentile, though this is not a final proposal. All MPs would receive this same wage, which would change on an annual basis as the average wage changes.

Serving MPs should not hold second jobs unless they can show that there is no conflict with their role as MP, both in terms of time required and conflict of interest. This includes directorships and advisory posts.

Allowed expenses would be reduced to only those costs incurred as part of their job; for instance, travel and accomodation.

Second home allowances will be scrapped, and MPs will instead have accomodation provided through parliament. This could be in dedicated accomodation, existing hotels, or long-term leases as appropriate. All MPs would be equally treated under this system.

## Government Ministers

Abolish the City Minister position, ending the privileged position of the City of London to influence policy at the expense of the wider public.

Limit the number of ministers, abolish Parliamentary Private Secretaries and further place a limit on the number or percentage of ruling party MPs that may serve in Government. Granting Government jobs to MPs has been used increasingly as a way to help ensure more MPs 'tow the party line' often in the face of staunch opposition from constituents. Limiting this tactic will help to ensure more MPs remain more accountable to their electorate, not the party.

Ban unelected Lords from serving in Government.
