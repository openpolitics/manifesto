How can we improve the democratic process, and citizens' engagement with it?

# Elections
Much apathy is focused around the perceived privilege of the political class. This is reinforced by the costs of attempting to stand for election. In the digital age, where a political campaign can be waged at little to no cost, the Â£500 deposit required to stand for election excludes some of the most enthusiastic and contributory members of society. These are people who often spent a majority of time volunteering in their community and don't have the income to save for such a high fee.
Candidacy should be open to all, regardless of financial wealth, if we are to have an open democracy.
