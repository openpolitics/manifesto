How can we improve the democratic process, and citizens' engagement with it?

# Elections
Much apathy is focused around the perceived privilege of the political class. This is reinforced by the costs of attempting to stand for election. In the digital age, where a political campaign can be waged at little to no cost, the £500 deposit required to stand for election excludes some of the most enthusiastic and contributory members of society. These are people who often spent a majority of time volunteering in their community and don't have the income to save for such a high fee.
Candidacy should be open to all, regardless of financial wealth, if we are to have an open democracy.
To deter time wasters, the current requirement of 10 nominations from the electorate to obtain candidacy will be increased to 20.
