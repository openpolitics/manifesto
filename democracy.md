How can we improve the democratic process, and citizens' engagement with it?

## Elections

Allow for full and proper recall of MPs: any e-petition to recall their MP supported by 20% of all registered constituency electors should trigger a local referendum (yes/no majority vote required) as to whether to hold a fresh bi-election.

Introduce an 'None of the Above' box on all ballot papers to formally and positively register abstention.

Introduce voting by proportional representation (Single Transferable Vote) in all General and Local Elections.

Investigate feasability of electronic voting at all elections, with a view to increasing accessibility and turnout.

Investigate feasability of direct digital democracy - using online tools to gradually replace representative democracy with increased direct participation in the legislative process by all electors.

Much apathy is focused around the perceived privilege of the political class. This is reinforced by the costs of attempting to stand for election. In the digital age, where a political campaign can be waged at little to no cost, the £500 deposit required to stand for election excludes some of the most enthusiastic and contributory members of society. These are people who often spent a majority of time volunteering in their community and don't have the income to save for such a high fee. Candidacy should be open to all, regardless of financial wealth, if we are to have an open democracy, so this deposit will be removed.

To deter time wasters, the current requirement of 10 nominations from the electorate to obtain candidacy will be increased to 20.

Reduce the age of voting at General, Scottish, and European Elections (ie to legislative bodies) and all national and local referenda to those aged 16 years and above.

Reduce the age of voting at Local Elections and to the Welsh Assemby (ie to non-legislative bodies) to those aged 15 to encourage youth participation in democracy prior to enjoying full voting right at 16. 

## Party Funding

Limit all donations and loans to political parties, campaign, lobbying and interest groups to a maximum of £5,000 from individuals and groups.

## Lords Reform

Create an elected Upper House of Parliament for single 15 year terms, with the explicit purpose of revising and improving (not vetoing) legislation initiated by HM Government in the House of Commons.

## Transparency

Require all MPs to publish details of any meeting with any individual or group who is not a constituent.

## Devolution

Devolve all legislative powers currently enjoyed by the Scottish Parliament to equivalent devolved Parliaments in England, Wales and (eventually) Northern Ireland. The UK Parliament to retain control over macro-economic, foreign, and defence policy.

## Local Democracy

### Structure

The current three-tier structure of local democracy (county, local and parish councils) will be reformed to remove the county and parish-level councils. Local authorities, as the current council tax collecting bodies, will take over responsibilities from county and parish councils.

Existing city-wide councils, such as Birmingham, will be split up into smaller town and district authorities.

Local authorities will be encouraged to share services and pool resources in order to save costs and provide a more efficient service.

New neighbourhood associations would be formed to replace parish councils but with no responsibility to deliver services, acting instead as a citizen-led accountability check on local authorities. As part of this, neighbourhood associations will be led by elected representatives. However, the party system will not apply - candidates will not be able to campaign as a party representative nor receive assistance from the local party branch. This will help to change the focus to local representatives rather than elections become pseudo-referenda.

### Funding

Local authorities will collect and retain council tax and business rates in their area. Additionally, there will be a "citizen premium" to ensure that there isn't a wide disparity in income between authorities. Any authority whose income fails to meet the level of the citizen premium will recieve a central government grant. Equally, any authority making a surplus will send that surplus to central government.
