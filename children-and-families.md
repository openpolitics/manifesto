title: Children and Families
---
Children are the next doctors, musicians, nurses, engineers, fire fighters and waiters, but only when each child has the same opportunities as the next. No child should be born into poverty and it's the job of the state to ensure equality of opportunity by supporting families and providing the support children need to make the most of life.

## Community Investment
Investment into community centers and youth centers for young people should be the most widespread ever in an effort to reduce the number of young people being pulled into criminal groups and activities. These centers should provide activities and areas for young people to relax, with pastoral care and education on topics such as sex/money/further education etc.
