## National Health Service

In order to support every citizen's basic right to medical care and health services, we will maintain and enhance the NHS, keeping it as a free service available to anyone in the UK.

In order to deliver a high quality of care in the NHS, the government must provide sufficient funding and investment in the system.

The NHS will not deny care to anyone for any reason, regardless of legal status, economic status, or nationality (for further details, see [doitreatthisimmigrant.com](http://doitreatthisimmigrant.com/)).

Ban parking charges in car parks serving NHS facilities. Only in cases where there is a serious, demonstrable abuse of parking by motorists not using the facilities will any regimes be permitted to curb such abuse, but these must never include a parking charge.

## Dentists

We have a "free at the point of delivery" National Health Service and for good reason - a healthy population is a productive population, and that reaps benefits for all. That does not however extend to an area of our health that influences our ability to eat and drink and that when not maintained adequately can lead to cancer.
Care of the mouth and teeth should be brought fully under the National Health Service and free at the point of delivery, sweeping away the often prohibitive costs for the poorest in society and ensuring that our world class health care system continues to beat it's international counterparts in keeping the nation in good health.

## Maternity and Paternity Leave

In order to encourage higher rates of breast feeding, longer term breast feeding and better long term health outcomes for the general population, mothers will be able to take full pay maternity leave for one year. Fathers will also be able to take one years full leave following the cessation of the mother's leave. Alternatively families can choose to share the leave so the mother has a higher proportion over the two years. This policy will improve the health and well-being of children, and the provision of early years care.
