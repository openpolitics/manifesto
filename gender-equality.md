title: Gender Equality

## Egalitarianism

It is our view that all polices regarding gender equality, especially when serving only a certain segment of the population rather than all (such as a policy applicable only to women or men), must ultimately serve an egalitarian end goal.

## Rape Law

Currently, UK rape legislation specifies PIV (penis-in-vagina) sex with a male perpetrator, or female or male perpetrator committing an act of non-consensual penetration. All other crimes commonly considered rape in society are dealt with under sexual assault due to its broad definition. We believe that this discriminates against LGBTQ+ people and the male sex (and those who otherwise posses a penis) in an unjustified manner, and thus seek to reform it. Under new legislation, we will have it encompass oral sex, PIV, all common forms of sex that can be performed by 2 women, all common forms of sex that can be performed by two men, and forced envelopment (female on male rape), with the condition that all of the previously mentioned are non consensual under the terms of consent currently set out in rape law, which we would preserve.

We would also conduct or commission a review of all existing help both governmental and otherwise for victims of rape under the new definition, and the act on the deficiencies and discrimination, or lack thereof, found in the resulting study.
