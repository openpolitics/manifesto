## Nuclear Disarmament

The United Kingdom should take a role as international leader in pursuit of global nuclear disarmament, beginning with a promise to discontinue its own existing nuclear arsenal following any reforms of its conventional forces necessary for the United Kingdom to meet its security needs and international obligations. The United Kingdom should be resolutely opposed to horizontal and vertical nuclear proliferation in all forms and lead by example in pursuit of a world free of nuclear warheads and delivery mechanisms. The UK should follow the [example set by New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand%27s_nuclear-free_zone) in declaring itself a nuclear arms free zone including its waters. 



## Role of UK Armed Forces

UK Armed Forces should only be deployed within the context of the international organisations to which the UK belongs (such as the UN, EU and NATO) and with the overall aim of either reducing the likelihood of war or other armed conflict or protecting non-combatants (see [Foreign Policy](foreign_policy.html)).

UK Armed Forces will be structured to focus on humanitarian, peace-keeping, peace enforcement, maritime search-and-rescue, mine and explosive ordnance clearance, anti-piracy, and counter-terrorism operations.

## Parliamentary Oversight

All foreign deployment of UK Armed Forces, as well as the use of UK Special Advisers and the provision of military support in foreign conflict zones, should be subject to Parliamentary approval.

## Defence Budget

Reviews of defence budgets will be tied to a review of commitments, not just expenditure, to ensure that UK Armed Forces are properly equipped and trained for the roles that our defence and foreign policies are demanding of them.

## Private Military and Security Companies

We will empower the SIA regulatory body to regulate private military and security companies (PMSCs) registered in the UK. All PMSCs will be required to register with this body, and they will then either receive approval to operate as a PMSC or not. PMSCs will have to seek approval with the regulatory body before accepting operational deployments. All approved operations will be a matter of public record, the full details of which will be published within 3 years. A list of private military contractors that are missing or killed whilst in the service of these PMSCs will also be collated and published quarterly.

We will push for an international regulatory body and statutes for PMSCs around the world, possibly administered through the UN. The international body could potentially incorporate both the [Montreux Document](https://www.globalpolicy.org/images/pdfs/0917montreuxdocument.pdf) and the [International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers](http://icoca.ch/sites/all/themes/icoca/assets/icoc_english3.pdf).

## Autonomous Weapon Systems

We will petition the UN and other international bodies to create an amendment to the Geneva Convention banning the development and use of electrical autonomously discharged weapon systems, ensuring that "who pulls the trigger" is entrusted solely to human oversight.
