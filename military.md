What level of military capability should we maintain? What role does our military have?

## Nuclear Disarmament

The UK should commit to not renewing the Trident Nuclear Deterrent in order to ensure it can afford sufficent conventional defence forces.  

## Role of UK Armed Forces

UK Armed Forces should be structured to focus on humanitarian, peace-keeping, peace enforcement, maritime search-and-rescue, mine and explosive ordnance clearance, anti-piracy, and counter-terrorism operations as well as providing support to UK emergency services during natural and civil disasters.

## Parliamentary Oversight

All foreign deployment of UK Armed Forces, as well as the use of UK Special Advisors and the provision of military support in foreign conflict zones, should be subject to Parliamentary approval.
