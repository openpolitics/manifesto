## Removal of Fossil Fuels

No new fossil-fuel powered vehicles may be sold in the UK after 2029.

## Replace Vehicle Excise Duty and Fuel Duty

The way our current tax system works is that it assumes that fuel bought at the pumps is going to be used for public road travel. This isn't always true. ‘Red fuel’ or ‘untaxed fuel’ provide some exceptions, but generally speaking if you want to buy petrol then you’re forced to pay a tax to maintain roads, which you might not be wearing down. Meanwhile the general public are taxed variably on emissions - even though emissions are assured from the use of petroleum.

'Vehicle Excise' Duty and 'Fuel Duty' will be replaced with an 'Emissions Tax' and 'Road Strengthening Tax' respectively.

These changes to the titles in the tax system are meant to reflect the given purpose of the tax, making them more understandable to the public; providing greater transparency to them about what they are being taxed for, and some degree of protection against double-taxation also.

The 'Emissions Tax' will be applied at a flat rate at the pumps, and will be based upon typical combustion values in the UK and upon the estimated environmental impact that these gases create.

The 'Road Strengthening Tax' will be applied at a variable rate to vehicles licensed to drive on public roads, and will be based upon vehicle type and weight. Vehicles which are heavy or typically use more of the roads (such as HGVs) will pay a lot of tax for road maintenance. Vehicles which are light or which use less of the roads (such as small family cars, or agricultural vehicles) will pay less tax.

What this should do is bring the cost of fuel down, while however unfortunately bringing the cost of "road tax" up. This could lead to greater evasion and therefore decreased government transport revenue.

The advantage though is that families who could not afford to buy fuel for heating, cooking or travel before would see the cost of fuel come down; as Fuel Duty, a regressive form of taxation (renamed to Emissions Tax), would be reduced.

## National Infrastructure Organisations

Network Rail, the Highways Agency, train operating companies and bus operating companies would all be required to become [National Infrastructure Organisations (NIOs)](infrastructure.html) under a policy to ensure that infrastructure which is essential to a functioning society is not solely operated for the benefit of private shareholders, but in the national interest.

## End UK airport expansion

Until the aviation industry is carbon neutral, there will be no further expansions (such as new runways or terminals) of any UK airports, and capacity shall be capped at roughly current levels.

## Get rid of Nude Body Scanners

We believe that other technologies and solutions exist that are able to better serve transport authorities in carrying out their responsibility in the interests of airport and national security.

## Cycling

Commit to investing in cycling infrastructure: dedicated and separate lanes; secure parking; making traffic junctions "cycle-safe"; encouraging shared use of pavements and paths where dedicated lanes are not feasible.

Put in place clear and simple standards to cover cycle lane design, signage, continuity and traffic signals. Extend existing transport planning requirements to always include these new cycling standards.

Put in place a program to bring existing roads up to these new standards.

Consult with leading cycle planning countries on setting down these standards.

## Driverless and Automated Vehicles

Work with automobile manufacturers to establish ways of providing infrastructure to support driverless vehicles.

Encourage automobile manufacturers to agree upon an open and non-proprietary standard for wireless automated vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to improve road safety by reducing both congestion and collisions.

## Electric and Alternative Fuel Vehicles

Incentivise existing fuelling stations to install charging units for electric vehicles to help create a nationwide network and overcome the perception of "range anxiety" amongst consumers.

Incentivise existing fuelling stations to install hydrogen fuel pumps.

Incentivise research into retrospective modifications to existing vehicles allowing them to run on hydrogen. This would facilitate an easier transition from our dependency on fossil fuels, and encourage the development of new hydrogen based vehicle (which doesn't have the same carbon footprint as the manufacture of lithium ion batteries.)

As the number of electric cars increases, an increasing amount of battery storage ends up being connected to the National Grid. This storage can be used to supply power back into the grid when it's under heavy load, and store up power when there is excess generation capacity. We will incentivise electric car owners who allow their cars to be used as dynamic storage batteries for the grid, and help smooth out variable demand.

## Railways

Develop a long-term plan for complete electrification of the national rail network, and the replacement of diesel trains with electric multiple-units. This has the benefit of reduced emissions, improved efficiency, quieter and more comfortable trains. Alongside electrification, signalling should be updated to [ETCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Train_Control_System) level 2 or 3 standard for improved safety and efficiency.

Investigate feasibility of building a high speed rail network that connects our ten largest cities (and Cardiff also) to the European high speed network via HS1.

Examine which areas of the United Kingdom were most detrimentally affected by the changes in the [Beeching Reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeching_cuts), and whether it would be economically feasible to bring back any formerly established railways.

## Bus

Promote efficient use of road space in towns and cities by allocating road space to bus lanes, encouraging the creation of a network of frequent bus routes.
