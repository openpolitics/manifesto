What policies could improve public and private transport infrastructure?

## Removal of Fossil Fuels

We will decrease emissions from road transport by setting a date beyond which no new fossil-fuel powered vehicles may be sold in the UK.

# National Infrastructure Organisations

Network Rail, the Highways Agency, train operating companies and bus operating companies would all be required to become [National Infrastructure Organisations (NIOs)](infrastructure.html) under a policy to ensure that infrastructure which is essential to a functioning society is not solely operated for the benefit of private shareholders, but in the national interest.

# End UK airport expansion

There will be no further expansions (such as new runways or terminals) of any UK airports, and capacity shall be capped at roughly current levels.


# Cycling 

Commit to investing in cycling infrastructure: dedicated and separate lanes; secure parking; making traffic junctions 'cycle-safe'; encouraging shared use of pavements and paths where dedicated lanes are not feasible.

Put in place clear and simple standards to cover cycle lane design, signage, continuity and traffic signals. Extend existing transport planning requirements to always include these new cycling standards.

Put in place a program to bring existing roads up to these new standards.

Consult with leading cycle planning countries on setting down these standards.

# Electric Vehicles

Incentivise existing fuelling stations to install charging units for electric vehicles to help create a nationwide network and overcome the perception of 'range anxiety' amongst consumers.
