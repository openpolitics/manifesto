What policies could improve public and private transport infrastructure?

## Removal of Fossil Fuels

We will decrease emissions from road transport by setting a date beyond which no new fossil-fuel powered vehicles may be sold in the UK.

# National Infrastructure Organisations

Network Rail, the Highways Agency, train operating companies and bus operating companies would all be required to become [National Infrastructure Organisations (NIOs)](infrastructure.html) under a policy to ensure that infrastructure which is essential to a functioning society is not solely operated for the benefit of private shareholders, but in the national interest.

# End UK airport expansion

There will be no further expansions (such as new runways or terminals) of any UK airports, and capacity shall be capped at roughly current levels.

# Driverless Vehicles

Work with automobile manufacturers to establish ways of providing infrastructure to support driverless vehicles.
