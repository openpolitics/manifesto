What should we do to enhance culture, and how should we ensure a robust but ethical media landscape?

## Press Complaints Commission

The PCC, currently a voluntary body run by the same people who it covers, should become an independent regulator (perhaps as part of OFCOM).

The PCC remit would remain narrow to avoid political interference in a free press, which is an essential component of a functioning democracy, but it should have powers to:

  * force publication of corrections in a particular format
  * apply substantial fines to news organisations which breach the Editor's Code[^1]
  * adjudicate on whether invasions of privacy by the press are truly in the public interest

The Editor's Code should include a clause barring discrimination and hate speech against a group, not just against individuals.
