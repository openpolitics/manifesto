What level of military capability should we maintain? What role does our military have?

## Nuclear Disarmament

The United Kingdom should take a role as international leader in pursuit of global nuclear disarmament, beginning with a promise to discontinue its own existing nuclear arsenal following any reforms of its conventional forces necessary for the United Kingdom to meet its security needs and international obligations. The United Kingdom should be resolutely opposed to horizontal and vertical nuclear proliferation in all forms and lead by example in pursuit of a world free of nuclear warheads and delivery mechanisms.

## Role of UK Armed Forces

UK Armed Forces should be deployed within the context of the international organisations to which the UK belongs (such as the UN, EU and NATO) and with the overall aim of reducing the likelihood of war or other armed conflict (see [Foreign Policy](foreign_policy.html))
When the UK Armed Forces are deployed or for the protection of UK interests, or those of other nations, the approval and participation of the appropriate international organisation shall be sought. Where such approval is not forthcoming the government should justify the decision to act.
The UK Armed Forces should not be deployed for unprovoked aggressive/expansionist hostilities.

UK Armed Forces should be structured to focus on humanitarian, peace-keeping, peace enforcement, maritime search-and-rescue, mine and explosive ordnance clearance, anti-piracy, and counter-terrorism operations as well as providing support to UK emergency services during natural and civil disasters.

## Parliamentary Oversight

All foreign deployment of UK Armed Forces, as well as the use of UK Special Advisors and the provision of military support in foreign conflict zones, should be subject to Parliamentary approval.

## Defence Budget

Reviews of defence budgets should be tied to a review of commitments, not just expenditure, to ensure that UK Armed Forces are properly equipped and trained for role our defence and foreign policies are demanding of them.
