What level of military capability should we maintain? What role does our military have?

## Nuclear Disarmament

The UK should commit to not renewing the Trident Nuclear Deterrent in order to ensure it can afford sufficent conventional defence forces.  

## Role of UK Armed Forces

UK Armed Forces should only be deployed within the context of the international organisations to which the UK belongs (such as the UN, EU and NATO) and with the overall aim of reducing the likelihood of war or other armed conflict (see [Foreign Policy](foreign_policy.html)).

UK Armed Forces should be structured to focus on humanitarian, peace-keeping, peace enforcement, maritime search-and-rescue, mine and explosive ordnance clearance, anti-piracy, and counter-terrorism operations as well as providing support to UK emergency services during natural and civil disasters.

## Parliamentary Oversight

All foreign deployment of UK Armed Forces, as well as the use of UK Special Advisors and the provision of military support in foreign conflict zones, should be subject to Parliamentary approval.

Membership of, and relationships with bodies, such as NATO, UN and the European Union should be managed with a clear view of the role that they play in the reduction (or otherwise) of the likelihood of war or other armed conflict in the future. 

## Defence Budget

Reviews of defence budgets should be tied to a review of commitments, not just expenditure, to ensure that UK Armed Forces are properly equipped and trained for role our defence and foreign policies are demanding of them.
