## Principles of Education

We believe that education is the keystone that makes all other longer-term strategic policies possible: improving industry and employment; the arts; scientific discovery and research; improving the overall health and well-being of society; and reducing crime. It is the policy area that can justify significant investment in recognition of the dividend that all other areas of public spending will receive 10-15 years hence.

Subsequently we recognise that education is about more than simply equipping the future workforce with relevant vocational and professional skills, but about creating a future society that is healthy, wise, and wealthy in all respects.

We believe that learning is life long and should be encouraged in all elements of life, personal and professional.

## Funding

Education should be freely available to all to first degree level or equivalent. 

Tuition fees for university students should be abolished, as university education is of general benefit to society, and should be covered by general taxation.

All school funding will be assessed on a pupil by pupil basis (to include a basic entitlement, additional needs, pupil premium top up etc) and these funds will stay with the child.  This will remove the inequality of the present funding system (where certain areas can recieve a lot less per child than others) but will also remove the need for "big bucket" approaches such as Pupil Premium.  On entry to the school system, each child will take with them guaranteed minimum funding (that can be adjusted if and when necessary to take into account life changes) and schools will be able to plan more effectively (especially with regards to children entering mid-year).  These funds will be valid as payment towards private education.

## Local Schools

Schools should reflect the local aspirations and desires of the communities they serve.  Mechanisms will be put in place to allow local communities more say in how schools are set up and run - including, but not limited to:

- powers to promote a broad cross-section of local people sitting on governing bodies.
- legal requirement to consult on progress with local communities at set intervals.
- further evolution of the Free School and Academy Programme to facilitate the setup or conversion of schools of any faith, speciality or none.
- An end to a two tier approach to school management - all maintained schools will be converted to Academies and current Local Education Authorities closed but a framework will be created to allow new style Education Authorities to be set up to manage chains/groups of Academies and Free Schools should local communities desire this.
- Inherent in all the above will be a desire to protect smaller local and rural schools and their individual characters.  We understand that this will come at substantial cost to the taxpayer and certain criteria will have to be met (i.e. school is well performing, has great potential etc) but this fits in with the local aspirations that we wish to encourage.

## School Governance

Powers to promote a broad cross-section of local people sitting on governing bodies.
Legal requirement to consult on progress with local communities at set intervals.
All state secondary schools will have an elected students council, and student president. The student president, who will need to be at key stage 4, will be a co-opted member on the board of governors.
