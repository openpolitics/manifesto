## Principles of Education

We believe that education is the keystone that makes all other longer-term strategic policies possible: improving industry and employment; the arts; scientific discovery and research; improving the overall health and well-being of society; and reducing crime. It is the policy area that can justify significant investment in recognition of the dividend that all other areas of public spending will receive 10-15 years hence.

Subsequently we recognise that education is about more than simply equipping the future workforce with relevant vocational and professional skills, but about creating a future society that is healthy, wise, and wealthy in all respects.

We believe that learning is life long and should be encouraged in all elements of life, personal and professional.

## Funding

Education should be freely available to all to first degree level or equivalent. Tuition fees for university students should be abolished, as university education is of general benefit to society, and should be covered by general taxation.

## Secular Schools

50% of the British public identify as having no religion[^1], and this number is growing [^5] and yet around 30% of state funded schools have a religious character[^2], including over 4,500 Church of England schools. It has been demonstrated that faith schools are religiously selective, excluding those of other or no faith[^3].

Therefore, we will mandate that all state-funded schools be secular in nature.

No state funded school will be permitted to admit students based on religiosity.

We will end compulsory worship in schools.

State-funded faith schools will also lose their exemption to equalities legislation, preventing them from practising religious discrimination in their employment policies.

Religious education (R.E.) will also be reviewed, starting with research on the current state of R.E. and followed by a consultation to include all interested parties on whether to keep R.E., reform it, or replace it with a proper academic subject such as Philosophy, Culture and Belief.

Local RE syllabuses will be replaced by a single national curriculum subject.

Non-religious beliefs such as Humanism will have equal prominence to religious beliefs when drawing up a new syllabus to replace RE.

Scottish authorities will no longer be legally obligated to appoint unelected religious representatives to school boards. Instead, elected councillors will be appointed by a vote of the full council.

## School Governance

All state secondary schools will have an elected students council, and student president. The student president, who will need to be at key stage 4, will represent students on the board of governors.

## Focus on Education

We will remove the guidelines[^4] that force teachers to act as counter-terrorism officers and that stifle free speech within the learning environment. 

## Sex and relationships education

All schools will be required to provide students with age-appropriate unbiased sex and relationships education as part of the national curriculum.

## Local Standing Advisory Council for Religious Education (SACRE) to be scrapped

These unelected local advisory groups are responsible for the oversight of Religious Education in the County. They draw up a local RE syllabus. They are inefficient and biased. Most of them exclude non-religious full members. Most local RE syllabuses are biased towards religious beliefs.
