How do we improve and reinvigorate local government?

## Transparency

Publish full minutes (or transcripts if available), audio recordings, and voting records from all local council meetings. Online publication should be performed within 24 hours. Software tools will be created to make this process simple.

## Scale

Sizes of local authorities in England vary massively. However, most unitary authorities measure between 150,000 to 300,000 in population. In Scotland the average is 165,000. The European average is 5000. In terms of kilometers squared, local authorities in Scotland span an area 45x the size of equivalent bodies in Europe[^1]. Much the same is true of rural local authorities in England and Wales. Local government should be about empowering communities and not managing them in absentia. As such steps should be taken to decentralise local government while ensuring they maintain powers they require to act. Where required joint-boards should be created or expanded to handle prevent splitting up services.
