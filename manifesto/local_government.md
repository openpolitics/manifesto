How do we improve and reinvigorate local government?

## Transparency

Publish full minutes (or transcripts if available), audio recordings, and voting records from all local council meetings. Online publication should be performed within 24 hours. Software tools will be created to make this process simple.

## Local policy making

In an attempt to re-invigorate and make accessible to all, community councils and parish councils should become the hosts for local policy making. Consequently, a councillor's responsiblity as a policy maker would be diminished in comaprison to their work co-ordinatating and administering the policies formulated by the parishes/community councils in his or her wards.
