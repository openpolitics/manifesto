How do we improve and reinvigorate local government?

## Transparency

Publish full minutes (or transcripts if available), audio recordings, and voting records from all local council meetings. Online publication should be performed within 24 hours. Software tools will be created to make this process simple.

## Waste and Environment

The Localism Act 2011 repealed powers under The Climate Change Act 2008 which gave councils the ability to charge fine or introduce tariffs regarding household waste. Local authorities are primarily responsible for waste collection and recycling. Consequently, local government should have the power to issue financial disincentives (and/or incentives) to encourage recycling and effective waste collection.

## Removing Party Politics from Town Council

Town Councils, which are effectively Parish Councils in all but name, have one distinct difference in that Councillors on Town Councils stand for political parties, whereas all Parish Councillors are not aligned. As Peter MacFayden notes in his book [Flatpack Democracy](http://www.flatpackdemocracy.co.uk/ "Flatpack Democracy"), "at local levels of representation, party politics as practiced by the current political parties are an irrelevant and corrosive diversion." We advocate the removal of party politics from Town Councils in the same way they are removed from Parish Councils.
