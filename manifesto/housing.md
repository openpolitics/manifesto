## Empty Properties

Residential properties that have been empty for more than 12 months will automatically attract a 100% increase in council tax.

A landlord of a property that has been unoccupied for 12 months or more can, once the property has been occupied for 12 months or more, claim a 6 month rebate on the council tax paid before the property was occupied.

Government-backed lending schemes will be offered to landlords with unoccupied residential properties that require refurbishment or repair in order to get them back into use.


## Rental Sector

With fewer people able to afford to buy, many are renting. We will carry out a public review, taking evidence from all relevant parties, into the private rented housing sector to look at;

  * landlord accountability
  * fairness in tenancy agreements
  * the effect of the rental sector on house prices
  * agency fees, their necessity and fairness

## Council Tax

Replace council tax with a Land Value Tax as detailed in Economy 5.1.

## Housing Benefit

Repeal the size criteria for housing benefit (commonly known as the "Bedroom Tax"), which punishes housing benefit claimants for having spare rooms when in many cases smaller properties are not available for them to move into.

## Supply

The fundamental shortage of the supply of housing has pushed up the cost of living to unaffordable levels, which contributes to lifetimes of debt and requires the state to spend too much supporting people just to put a roof over their heads. The main beneficiaries of the high cost of housing (whether rent or mortgage) are the banks and large companies through the effective wage subsidy of housing benefit.
The only way to solve this problem in the long term is a sustained large scale increase in the housing supply, driving down the cost of putting a roof over ones head. This will also put more money in people's pockets which will benefit the rest of the economy.
For this step change in supply to take place, we must accept fundamental changes to planning laws, increasing the supply and therefore reducing the cost of land that can be built on - as this cost is the biggest contributor to overall housing costs, rather than the actual building.
