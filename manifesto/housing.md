## Empty Properties

Residential properties that have been empty for more than 12 months will automatically attract a 100% increase in council tax.

A landlord of a property that has been unoccupied for 12 months or more can, once the property has been occupied for 12 months or more, claim a 6 month rebate on the council tax paid before the property was occupied.

Government-backed lending schemes will be offered to landlords with unoccupied residential properties that require refurbishment or repair in order to get them back into use.


## Rental Sector

With fewer people able to afford to buy, many are renting. We will carry out a public review, taking evidence from all relevant parties, into the private rented housing sector to look at;
  * landlord accountability
  * fairness in tenancy agreements
  * the effect of the rental sector on house prices
  * agency fees, their necessity and fairness

## Council Tax

Investigate a fairer system than the current 'band' system of council tax.

## Property Rationing

Property is in extremely limited supply in the UK. This has led to soaring house prices, and created a 'generation rent' of young adults who may never be able to afford their own property. As with food that was in limited supply during and after the Second World War, property should be rationed to ensure adequate supply in the housing market, which will help ensure prices remain affordable. It is proposed that each adult be entitled to own a maximum of two properties in addition to their declared main residence, which will allow a limited buy-to-let market, without permitting anyone to accumulate a vast property porfolio. This would also encourage people to focus their efforts on the generation of earned incomes, rather than unearned income from rents.
