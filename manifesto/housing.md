## Empty Properties

Residential properties that have been empty for more than 12 months will automatically attract a 100% increase in council tax.

A landlord of a property that has been unoccupied for 12 months or more can, once the property has been occupied for 12 months or more, claim a 6 month rebate on the council tax paid before the property was occupied.

Government-backed lending schemes will be offered to landlords with unoccupied residential properties that require refurbishment or repair in order to get them back into use.

### A new squatters right

There are over 200,000 long-term empty homes in the UK http://www.emptyhomes.com/statistics-2/empty-homes-statistice-201112/

We believe that housing is an essential utility for modern life and that it is unethical to hoard such scarce resource.

We propose a new system of squatters rights to incentivise owners of empty homes to bring their popert back into occupation. In order to benefit from the right to occupy an empty home, the following conditions must be met:
# The property must be a residential property and must have been unoccupied for at least six months
# Squatters must pay Council Taxes as the occupier
# Squatters must maintain the property in good order and rectify any damage beyond reasonable wear and tear
# Squatters must not unreasonably under or over occupy a property
# Squatters must not incur any anti social behaviour sanction (unrelated to the act of squatting itself)
# Squatters must vacate the property at three months notice if the property owner can prove their intent to bring the property back into occupation. Property owners who use this provision to gain possession of a property but who fail to arrange for the reoccupation of the property after a reasonable time will be liable to a fine payable to the evicted squatters and will be required to allow the return of the squatters, again under the above conditions.

## Rental Sector

With fewer people able to afford to buy, many are renting. We will carry out a public review, taking evidence from all relevant parties, into the private rented housing sector to look at;

  * landlord accountability
  * fairness in tenancy agreements
  * the effect of the rental sector on house prices
  * agency fees, their necessity and fairness

## Council Tax

Replace council tax with a Land Value Tax as detailed in Economy 5.1.

## Housing Benefit

Repeal the size criteria for housing benefit (commonly known as the "Bedroom Tax"), which punishes housing benefit claimants for having spare rooms when in many cases smaller properties are not available for them to move into.
