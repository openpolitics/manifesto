## Empty Properties

Residential properties that have been empty for more than 12 months will automatically attract a 100% increase in council tax.

A landlord of a property that has been unoccupied for 12 months or more can, once the property has been occupied for 12 months or more, claim a 6 month rebate on the council tax paid before the property was occupied.

Government-backed lending schemes will be offered to landlords with unoccupied residential properties that require refurbishment or repair in order to get them back into use.


## Rental Sector

With fewer people able to afford to buy, many are renting. We will carry out a public review, taking evidence from all relevant parties, into the private rented housing sector to look at;

  * landlord accountability
  * fairness in tenancy agreements
  * the effect of the rental sector on house prices
  * agency fees, their necessity and fairness

## Council Tax

Council tax will be discontinued and replaced with a 'Property tax', set at 0.5% of the property's value and payable by the owner of the property whether it is occupied or not. The property's value will be calculated by an initial valuation, and then rise or fall annually in line with the ONS regional house price index (HPI). 

## Housing Benefit

Repeal the size criteria for housing benefit (commonly known as the "Bedroom Tax"), which punishes housing benefit claimants for having spare rooms when in many cases smaller properties are not available for them to move into.
