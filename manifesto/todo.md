There are plenty of areas where we don't yet have anything in the manifesto. If you're looking to contribute but are unsure where to start, why not have a look at one of these areas?;

* Israel-Palestine conflict
* Scottish independence/the West Lothian question ([related discussion](https://github.com/openpolitics/manifesto/issues/28))
* Leveson and media plurality
* Arts funding
* House building
* Local Government ([seems light](http://openpolitics.org.uk/manifesto/local_government.html))

Think there's other things we're missing but don't have a proposal of your own? Edit this page to add them!
