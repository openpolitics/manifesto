What policies should we adopt in our relations with other countries?

## European Union

We believe that the UK should continue to be a strong voice in the EU. We believe that the EU project is worth pursuing, as it has brought major advantages in terms of political and military stability, scientific progress, economic power, and global influence.

However, we also know that the EU is in need of major reform to fit the politics of the future. Bureaucracy and waste must be reduced, and counter-productive programmes overhauled or removed.

We will remain a part of the EU, and we will campaign for:

  * Major reform or removal of the Common Agricultural Policy, to operate in harmony with the natural environment and remove market distortions.
  * Reform of fishing policy and quotas, reducing waste and allowing fish stocks to recover for the long term future of EU fisheries.
  * Reform of the Emissions Trading Scheme (see [Environment](environment.html) for more details).
  * Increased democratic control of EU institutions, with improved accountability and transparency.
  * A reduction in bureaucracy and inefficiency.

## Arms Trading

Commit to ensuring that no British-built arms are sold to nations that are likely to use those arms against their own people, or to any other agent or third party that may do so.

## Nuclear Disarmament

Commit to working towards a nuclear-weapon-free world by not renewing the Trident Nuclear Deterrent, and encouraging other nations to follow.

## Capital Punishment

We strongly oppose Capital Punishment in all forms, and would work with other nations to try and achieve a worldwide commitment to end death sentences by 2020.

## United Nations Reform

Whilst it's right that those nations that make the greatest contribution to UN troop deployments should retain a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, no nation on the UN Security Council should have the right of veto. All UN Security Resolutions should be subject to majority vote.

## Reforming the EU

There should be only one seat for the European Parliament in Brussels. The Strasbourg seat should be abolished.

Former Commissioners of the EU have first hand experience of how the institutions work, and how they could be improved. Unfortunately their [pensions are dependent](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/4996440/Lord-Mandelson-must-remain-loyal-to-EU-to-guarantee-pension.html) upon them not speaking out against the EU. They should be free to lobby for reform without fear of losing their pension.

The Commission should lose its monopoly on legislative initiative. The European Parliament should be able to initiate legislation in a system equivalent to a private members bill at Westminster.

Each member state government should lose the power to appoint a single Commissioner - a system of crony appointments that is undemocratic and unaccountable. Instead each Commissioner should be drawn from the single largest party of the European Parliament, with each member state having at least one Commissioner where possible. In this way the EU would adopt a truly Parliamentary system where the Executive arm sits within the Legislature, rather than sitting outside it.
