## Capital Punishment

We are opposed to the death penalty for all crimes, and would vote against any
attempt to reintroduce it.

## Removal of British Citizenship for Criminal Acts 

We are opposed to the removal of British citizenship as a sentence for committing criminal offences, which may leave individuals stateless. We also reject the suggestion of denying entry into the UK for British citizens suspected of committing offences abroad without having undergone due criminal proceedings. Where reasonable suspicion of such a criminal act occurs it should be investigated for possible prosecution within the criminal justice system. 

## Right to Die

Ensure euthanasia is permissible and available for those with conditions causing the individual such pain that they wish to end their own life but cannot do so without assistance. Medical staff and loved ones aiding anyone under such circumstances should not be prosecuted providing clear (and independently witnessed) consent has been given.

## War on Drugs

We will end the unwinnable war on drugs. Recreational drug use will be legalised under a program of regulation.

## Police

All frontline Police officers will be equipped with personal cameras for the potential reduction in complaints and violence[^1]

## Courts

A single, secular oath will replace the current options for witnesses in all court proceedings.

Specifically outlaw 'religious courts'.

Implement rigorous protection regimes for whistleblowers.

A review will be carried out into the composition of juries, especially for complex trials.
