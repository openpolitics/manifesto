What policies should we adopt to ensure a fair justice system?

## Right to Die

Ensure euthanasia is permissible and available for those with conditions causing the individual such pain that they wish to end their own life but cannot do so without assistance. Medical staff and loved ones aiding anyone under such circumstances should not be prosecuted providing clear (and independently witnessed) consent has been given.

## War on Drugs

We will end the unwinnable war on drugs. Recreational drug use will be legalised under a program of regulation.

## Police

All frontline Police officers will be equipped with personal cameras for the potential reduction in complaints and violence[^1]

Police and Crime Commissioners will be abolished and replaced with the previous system of Police Authorities comprised of local elected representatives, independent community members and magistrates.

## Courts

A single, secular oath will replace the current options for witnesses in all court proceedings.

Specifically outlaw 'religious courts' and implement rigorous protection regimes for whistleblowers.
