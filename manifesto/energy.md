The UK must move to a sustainable and diversified energy future, while safeguarding
supply and decreasing dependency on sources of energy in the more volatile areas of
the world.

## Decarbonisation

We will aim to decarbonise the electricity supply by 2030, through a comprehensive UK-wide programme of energy efficiency and renewable generation. New nuclear power stations are extremely expensive and unresponsive to demand, and are therefore not part of the new energy scenario. 

Energy storage will form a significant part of the UK's R&D activity in the sector, and existing R&D programmes for the nuclear industry will be wound down or redirected towards battery and hydrogen technologies.

## Resilience and Self-Sufficiency

We will ensure that energy is generated from a mixture of UK and EU supplies by working towards the EU-wide DC supergrid. All non-EU supplies of energy will be minimised and eventually stopped in order to protect the UK from foreign coercion, or from incentivising an expeditionary foreign policy.  

## Green Power for the Public Sector

In order to stimulate the renewable power sector, all public sector organisations and [National Infrastructure Organisations](infrastructure.html) will be required to buy as much of their power as possible from zero-carbon sources, with a target to reach 100% by 2020.

## Feed in Tariff

Continuation of the Feed in Tariff, and the Renewable Heat Incentive. Strong focus on community involvement and participation, with a presumption in favour in the planning system for projects which have a greater than 50% legal ownership.

## Fossil Fuel Industry

A complete moratorium on fracking, and tapered decreasing tax incentives for fossil fuel extraction.
