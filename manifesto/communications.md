What policies do we need to adopt regarding communications technologies like the Internet?

## Internet Freedom

We believe in a free and open Internet, and back the principles of Internet governance espoused by the [Declaration of Internet Freedom](http://www.internetdeclaration.org/freedom). Aspects of these principles are also expanded upon below.

## Access

In a connected future, Internet access is a basic right. Moving the process of government and democracy online requires that all homes be connected to high-speed broadband services to ensure equality of access.

## Surveillance

All communications (whether physical or digital) by individuals and groups, should be considered private property and free from state surveillance (or surveillance by agents or companies working on behalf of, or at the behest of, the State) without a judicially approved warrant in relation to a specific threat.

## Censorship

Remove all government-mandated filtering of Internet content, and make censorship by the government unconstitutional.

ISPs may give users the option to apply content filters on their connections, and even enable them by default if they wish, but filter lists must be openly published, and subject to review and appeal through OFCOM.

## Net Neutrality

Internet Service Providers should treat all network data equally, without restriction or throttling based on the type of content, the content provider, or any other criterion. The appropriate regulatory body (currently OFCOM) would be responsible for enforcing this policy and dealing with breaches.

## Internet Freedom

We support the declaration of internet freedom which believes in the following principles:

- We stand for a free and open Internet.
- We support transparent and participatory processes for making Internet policy and the establishment of five basic principles:
- Expression: Don't censor the Internet.
- Access: Promote universal access to fast and affordable networks.
Openness: Keep the Internet an open network where everyone is free to connect, communicate, write, read, watch, speak, listen, learn, create and innovate.
Innovation: Protect the freedom to innovate and create without permission. Don’t block new technologies and don’t punish innovators for their users' actions.
Privacy: Protect privacy and defend everyone’s ability to control how their data and devices are used.
