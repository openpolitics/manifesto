We believe that the UK should be a truly democratic country, where the state is properly accountable to its citizens. In the short term, this means improving the existing system in various ways, such as by improving the electoral system, changing how parties are funded, curbing the influence of the lobbying industry, and replacing the House of Lords with an elected chamber. In the long term, we believe that the UK should be a secular republic rather than a monarchy, and that at some point in the future technology will allow us to make decisions using some form of direct democracy rather than needing to elect representatives.

## Written Constitution

The British constitution should be collected into a single written document that defines and regulates the powers of the British government, and the rights and duties of its citizens[^1].

The constitution will be created with broad participation from the citizenry, and approval and adoption shall be subject to a referendum.

## Electoral Reform

Introduce a 'None of the Above' box on all ballot papers to formally and positively register abstention.

Introduce voting by proportional representation using the Single Transferable Vote (STV) method in all General and Local Elections.

Investigate the feasibility of electronic voting at all elections, with a view to increasing accessibility and turnout.

Reduce the age of voting at General, Scottish, and European Elections (ie to legislative bodies) and all national and local referenda to those aged 16 years and above.

Reduce the age of voting at Local Elections and to the Welsh Assemby (ie to non-legislative bodies) to those aged 15 to encourage youth participation in democracy prior to enjoying full voting right at 16.

## Recall of Representatives

Allow for full and proper recall of MPs: any e-petition to recall their MP supported by 20% of all registered constituency electors should trigger a local referendum (yes/no majority vote required) as to whether to hold a fresh byelection.

## Elected House of Lords

Create an Upper House of Parliament which is selected from the population by lottery, with the explicit purpose of revising and improving (not vetoing) legislation initiated by HM Government in the House of Commons.

## Party Funding

Limit all donations and loans to political parties, campaign, lobbying and interest groups to a maximum of £5,000 from individuals and groups.

Constituency offices of MPs, which quite rightly are publicly funded, should be solely for the use of casework officers, diary assistants etc to assist the MP in dealing with constituency issues. They should not be used for campaigning purposes or for locating agents, campaign managers, or other party officials, and thereby giving a publicy funded electoral advantage to incumbents over challengers.  

## Standing for Election

Much apathy is focused around the perceived privilege of the political class. This is reinforced by the costs of attempting to stand for election. In the digital age, where a political campaign can be waged at little to no cost, the £500 deposit required to stand for election excludes some of the most enthusiastic and contributory members of society. These are people who often spent a majority of time volunteering in their community and don't have the income to save for such a high fee. Candidacy should be open to all, regardless of financial wealth, if we are to have an open democracy, so this deposit will be removed.

To deter time wasters, the current requirement of 10 nominations from the electorate to obtain candidacy will be increased to 20.

Prospective parliamentary candidates must have a good connection with the constituency they wish to represent. This enforces the connection between representatives and their constituents and helps to disqualify candidates that are "flown in" by the party ahead of local choices.

## European Elections

Given each EU member country has the right to select the electoral system they use to elect their own MEPs, the Open Party List sytem (using the 'most-open' method) will also be used for elections to the European Parliament.

## Transparency

Require all MPs to retrospectively publish their diaries on a daily basis as open data.

Publish full minutes (or transcripts if available), audio recordings, and voting records from all local council meetings. Online publication should be performed within 24 hours. Software tools will be created to make this process simple.

A local accountability service will be provided online to show, for each local authority;

* spending records (including spending below £500)
* council political make-up and details of councillors (similar to that provided by [OpenlyLocal](http://openlylocal.com))
* details of councillor connections with companies and charities (i.e. shareholding and directorships)
* searchable transcripts and video recordings of all public council meetings (similar to [TheyWorkForYou.com](http://theyworkforyou.com))

To improve the ability of citizens to hold politicians to account for the promises they make, the National Archives' remit for creating an archive of Government publications will be extended to political campaign material produced by political parties. This will primarily be done by collecting copies of all material distributed by Royal Mail as part of election campaigns. Political party manifestos will also be archived by the National Archives.

## Devolution

We support the principle of subsidiarity, in the general sense that decisions should be devolved to the most local organisational level capable of effectively handling the issue.

Our current view is that:
a) We should consider devolving legislative powers currently enjoyed by the Scottish Parliament to equivalent devolved Parliaments in regions across England, Wales and (eventually) Northern Ireland. 
b) The UK Parliament to retain control over macro-economic, foreign, and defence policy.
c) To ensure resources continue to be redistributed from each region according to their ability to pay, to each region according to their need (as is currently the case) all current taxes set by Westminster would become 'Federal Taxes' and distributed as appropriate, and each regional Parliament should have the power to establish top-up 'Regional Taxes' either on income, VAT, capital gains or however they see fit, and to keep any revenue generated. Those wishing to attract investment may choose not to levy any regional taxes at all, or keep them lower relative to their neighbour. 

In the case that a local area is unable to deal with any issue effectively, there shall be an escalation path available to ensure that the issue can be decided at the next broader level.

## MPs pay and expenses

MPs should be paid a good wage, based on the income profile of the country. In the first instance, we propose that this should be set at 3.0x median wage. All MPs would receive this same wage, which would change on an annual basis as the median wage changes.

Serving MPs should not hold second jobs unless they can show that there is no conflict with their role as MP, both in terms of time required and conflict of interest. This includes directorships and advisory posts.

Allowed expenses would be reduced to only those costs incurred as part of their job; for instance, travel and accomodation.

Second home allowances will be scrapped, and MPs will instead have accommodation provided through parliament. This could be in dedicated accommodation, existing hotels, or long-term leases as appropriate. All MPs would be treated equally  under this system.

## Government Ministers

Abolish the City Minister position, ending the privileged position of the City of London to influence policy at the expense of the wider public.

Limit the number of ministers, abolish Parliamentary Private Secretaries and further place a limit on the number or percentage of ruling party MPs that may serve in Government. Granting Government jobs to MPs has been used increasingly as a way to help ensure more MPs 'toe the party line' often in the face of staunch opposition from constituents. Limiting this tactic will help to ensure more MPs remain more accountable to their electorate, not the party.

Ban unelected Lords from serving in Government.

Cabinet appointments will be subject to a vote of approval by the House of Commons.

## Royal Secrecy

Fully include of the monarchy within the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), so that the royal household is legally obliged to respond to information requests[^2].

Repeal existing exemptions from the FOIA that allow communications between other government bodies and the members of the royal family to be kept secret.

Adopt full disclosure of royal lobbying and influence, including disclosure of meetings between members of the royal family and ministers.

## Republic

To become a truly democratic country, the UK should become a republic. As a long-term goal, the monarchy would be replaced with an elected President who will act as Head of State. We recommend the [model proposed by Republic](http://republic.org.uk/What%20we%20want/In%20depth/The%20Case%20for%20a%20Republic/Policy/index.php).

The President would be mainly a ceremonial position, and should be apolitical and not affiliated to any party. The Prime Minster would remain as Head of Government, and would be appointed by the President after a General Election, as is the case with the Queen now. The President will not be involved in the legislative process.

Presidential terms of office will be fixed at five years, with a maximum of two terms to be served by an individual.

The President will be equal before the law, and will not be protected by [Sovereign Immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity#United_Kingdom). The President will not be constitutionally linked to any faith.

## Direct Democracy

Investigate the feasibility of direct digital democracy - using online tools to gradually replace representative democracy with increased direct participation in the legislative process by all electors.
