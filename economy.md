What policies should we propose to maintain a competitive economy that provides sufficient employment?

Ensure worker-owned cooperatives and mutuals are given priority with all government contracts.

Investigate viability of moving from an income-assessed direct taxation to wealth assessed direct taxation. Those who earn significant salaries but do not accumulate wealth or assets beyond a single property (ie ensuring a genuine 'trickle-down' to the service industries) should be taxed less. This means hard-work is still encouraged, high-earners are not forced abroad, but those who sit on vast sums of accumulated wealth would be penalised instead.
