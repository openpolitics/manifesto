What policies should we propose to maintain a competitive economy that provides sufficient employment?

# Income Tax
The personal income tax allowance will be set at the level of a full time living wage (currently £14,458.50 based on 252 working days of 7.5 hours per day at £7.65) and will rise inline with the living wage.

# VAT
VAT should only apply to luxury goods and services. It should be possible for the poorest households to fully equip themselves without ever being subject to paying VAT. Most basic household items or clothing, even a two-piece lounge suit, can be purchased for less than £100. It is therefore proposed levying the standard rate of VAT on any single item that retails at £100 or greater. This would mean packaged food, basic restaurant food, simple items of adult clothing, basic electrical goods, that all currently attract the standard rate of VAT, would become much cheaper and available to all.
