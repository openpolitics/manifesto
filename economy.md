title: Economy
---

Markets are a tool for society, not as the primary reason for it. The economy should work for everyone, not just billionaires, hedge funds and investment banks. Excessive [rent-seeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking) (gaining wealth from from financial speculation and intellectual property) increases inequality. In the short to medium term, we seek to rebalance the economy to reduce this by ensuring wage income is closer to rentier income.

## National Investment Bank

Re-nationalise the UK Green Investment Bank and rename and restructure it as the National Investment Bank (NIB). The NIB will also be merged with the Public Works Loan Board and the Infrastructure and Projects Authority.

The NIB shall be capitalised with £20 billion, drawn primarily from the sale of the government’s shares of private banks following the financial crisis, the [removal of subsidies for fossil fuels](http://openpolitics.org.uk/manifesto/environment.html#subsidies), and the existing funds held by the UK Green Investment Bank.

The aim will be to raise £500 billion in investment over the next 20 years and invest that into infrastructure and technology.

The NIB will target particularly deprived or underfunded regions, and local authorities will also be able to make the case for investment in their region.

## Minimum Wage

The minimum wage should be eliminated and replaced with Three Pillars of income support:

National Dividend (ND) - a payment to all citizen-residents, paid for by a tax on the commons

National Income Supplement (NIS) - distributing all income taxes back to income earners, which would allow all income brackets to benefit from each others' success, and amplify their earnings (and underwrite labour costs to ensure full employment)

Assisted Savings Program (ASP) - mandatory long-term savings/investment, and distributing all capital gains taxes to ASP accounts, ensuring savers benefit from each others' success, and amplify their savings

Returning tax revenues to citizens through these programs is enabled by a shift to a form of Land Value Tax (called a ULT) for general revenues.

## Taxation

We must return income taxation revenues as cash payments through the Three Pillars and Sectoral Banks, to ensure that incomes rise together, and that wages are underwritten to maintain full employment, and to eliminate poverty. Main government expenditures should be funded through taxes on rents, such as land values, pollution, and special privileges (for example those which the financial sector holds), as well as a Progressive Consumption Tax. This would ensure fairness & proper compensation for the use of our natural and social resources, a stable revenue base, high economic growth, and a reversal of our current account deficit. Capital gains tax revenues would be injected back into the market by distributing these revenues across the entire populations' accounts based on their saving/investment contributions. This would encourage saving & investment while ensuring everyone has ample emergency and retirement savings, without the need for a bankrupt state pension system.

### Replacement of VAT with a Progressive Consumption Tax

All goods categorised as non-critical, non-staple and non-utilitarian will incur a luxury goods tax. All other goods are to receive exemptions. For example: beer, chocolate, furniture, basic data retrieval and internet services, etc will be exempt from Luxury Goods Tax. However for the purposes of this tax, tobacco & modes of transportation shall be categorised as luxury goods.

### Tax Havens

Close down all tax havens under British jurisdiction. This means reforming tax rules in the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, and others.

In parallel, work at an international level to get rid of tax havens outside British jurisdiction, and close international loopholes such as the "Double Irish Dutch Sandwich".

## Basic Income

As more jobs, both skilled and unskilled, become automated we will introduce a [universal basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income), with the aim of eradicating poverty and providing a basic standard of living for all in a future where permanent employment is less necessary. A basic income would be implemented in the form of the Three Pillars system as described above.

## Housing

Improve rental rights, such that residential tenants cannot be evicted if they are paying market rate rent and have not damaged the property. Create a general principle that for tenants a property is their home and core to their life, whereas for landlords it is but a piece of property and simply a financial asset.

## Land Value Tax

Adopt Land Value Taxation (LVT)[^lvt], a charge on the rental value of land not including any improvements made on the site (such as buildings, drainage and services). Valuation to be based on market evidence, in accordance with the optimum use of the land within the planning regulations and updated regularly (at least every 2 years)[^lvt-england][^lvt-scotland]. LVT would replace Council Tax,  Uniform Business Rates, and Stamp Duty. There will be two rates of Land Value Tax - a national rate and a local rate. The national rate will be decoded after consultation and research. The local rate will be set at the discretion of each local authority. Public open space, public transport infrastructure and open water will all be exempt from LVT. Local and national government property will not be exempt, to encourage the efficient allocation of publicly owned assets.

## Metric System

We will complete the metrication of the UK started in 1965, but never completed. The remaining uses of imperial units should be phased out and replaced with the modern metric equivalent, as recommended by the [UK Metric Association](http://metric.org.uk/).

## Government Contracts

Ensure worker-owned cooperatives and mutuals are given priority with all government contracts.

All private companies who receive public money must be subject to the same transparency requirements as governments when it comes to the goods and services they deliver[^secret-contracts].

[^secret-contracts]: *"Stop Secret Contracts"*: [http://stopsecretcontracts.org/](http://stopsecretcontracts.org/)

Stimulate innovation on the demand side by requiring that 5% of Government Procurement comes from companies meeting 2 of the following 3 criteria:

  * Fewer than 20 employees
  * Established within the last 3 years
  * A spin-out of UK University technology

## Public Sector

In order to stimulate adoption of the living wage, and act as a good example, all public sector organisations and [National Infrastructure Organisations](infrastructure.html) will be required to pay employees at least a living wage.

All public sector organisations will have to use open source software and services where available. Proprietary software that is currently in use should be examined for open source alternatives. A timeline should be created and made public to show how and when the body will convert to this alternative in a reasonable period of time. This is to cut down on public sector costs and increase our society's participation in the open source culture.

## P2P Open Source Currency and role of Central Bank

We will instruct HM Treasury to produce a roadmap for the future of currency and the role of central banks in a world with non-state-issued digital currencies, such as Bitcoin.

Actively facilitate wider use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to create greater heterogeneity in monetary supply and therefore greater resilience to future financial crises.

Encourage development of local/regional currencies to reduce food miles, stimulate local economies, create greater transparency between producer and consumer; and encourage greater sense of community.

Potentially facilitate mechanisms to link the aforementioned cryptocurrencies and local currencies so that economic gains in one local currency can readily be used in  another area too. Thereby creating significant parts of the economy that run in parallel but importantly would be isolated from contagion of any toxic financial products created in the mainstream banking sector.

## Land Ownership

Follow recommendations regarding transparency in the [Lyons Housing Review](http://www.yourbritain.org.uk/uploads/editor/files/The_Lyons_Housing_Review_2.pdf) - "To ensure greater transparency in the land market, the Land Registry should open up land ownership
information to the public in a similar manner as the property price paid data set and make it a legal
requirement to register land option agreements, transactions and prices."

## Ownership
When you buy something, it should be owned (not a license to use). A preventative measure to reduce risk of vendor lock-in and promote ability to fix and modify purchased products.

## Licensing and Monopolies
Rules must be implemented to streamline and minimize licensing, including occupational licensing, and reform the patent system, in a way which ensures that competition is maximized. Currently, corporations utilize licensing and special privileges to stifle competition and create oligopolies, which dramatically slows growth, lowers wages, and halts productivity gains. This must be urgently resolved.

## Anti-Corruption and Anti-Waste Measures
A completely independent (arms-length from government) ministry must be created to audit the rest of government for waste, ineffectiveness, unnecessary red tape, and to tackle corruption. It should have the means to directly report to the public, and the use of specialized courts. All policy measures are ineffective if government institutions themselves are ineffective.
