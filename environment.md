What policies should we propose to protect our environment?

## Reducing Carbon Dioxide Emissions

Historically, the UK bears a large portion of blame for the current issue of climate change, and we must take a leadership
position to show other countries the way forward.

We are committed to meeting (or ideally beating) the emissions target for 2050 set in the Climate Change Act 2008. 

In order to meet this target, we will create a complete and legally-binding national carbon 
budget for the entire period up to 2050, so that we reduce uncertainty for investors, businesses,
and citizens about the route ahead.

We will aim to decarbonise the electricity supply by 2030, through a combination of renewable generation and new nuclear 
power (including alternative nuclear generation methods such as Thorium power). Fossil fuel plants will be allowed to operate
only if capturing 100% of their carbon emissions using CCS technology.

We will decrease emissions from road transport by setting a date beyond which no new fossil-fuel powered vehicles may be sold in the UK.

All subsidies and tax breaks for fossil fuel companies will be removed.

We will introduce a functioning national carbon trading scheme that sets a yearly carbon cap, and provides a 
market-based means for the country to stay below the cap. Existing polluters will not be 'grandfathered' into 
such a system and given pollution permits for free, and all polluting activities will be included.

We will campaign within the EU for reform of the EU ETS.

We will push for increased climate action and leadership within all international organisations, such as the EU and UN.

We will mandate solar panels be installed on every house as part of developments of ten homes or more, with excess generation fed into the national grid and the proceeds returned to the homeowners.
